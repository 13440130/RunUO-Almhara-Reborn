They're lead by two sisters, Lady Lissith and Lady Sabrix. There's been rumors floating around that the two sisters were originally part of a traveling expedition into the pit for reasons even I don't quite remember. Regardless of the details, it was a stupid move wandering that deep into the caverns and low and behold they fell one by one to the ravenous creepy crawlies. Except for the sisters. Nah, the Arachnid Aerials had big plans in mind for those two. Gone is their memories of being human, now resulting in them cultivating ways of striking back at the surface dwellers for disturbing their eternal slumber. I need for you to go down there and put a stop to both of them before they start wrecking havoc upon not only the jungle, but to everything and everyone that lives on the Zaythalor continent. Is this something you can muster up the courage for.";

Those scars all over your body are definitive proof that you've conquered those spiders and now that the sisters are gone, hopefully that'll be the end of anyone attempting to go through those caverns again.
