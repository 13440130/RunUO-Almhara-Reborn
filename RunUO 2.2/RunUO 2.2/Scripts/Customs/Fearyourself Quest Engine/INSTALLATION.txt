To install this little script nothing is needed to be done in the rest of RunUO scripts...

All you have to do is put this Fearyourself folder in your Customs directory.

Then load up the game and you have to first create a center :

[add LoggedQuestCenter 

Note : Only create one LoggedQuestCenter, for the moment I haven't handled the case of multiple centers.

You can then play with the BunnyAttack Quest :

[add Bob

Or with the ChainOfMammals Quest

[add Alfred

Note : Make sure you have a nice line on the X axis for this one, he automatically creates 4 guys... 



If you want to remove the animals their names are :

BobsRabbit
AlfredsRat
BriansJackRabbit


Have fun and good luck,
Jc
